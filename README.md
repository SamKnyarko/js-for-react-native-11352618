This project demonstrates basic array manipulation and formatting operations in JavaScript, along with creating and handling user profile objects

### Task 1: arrayManipulation.js
- **processArray**: This function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array. In the new array, each even number is squared, and each odd number is tripled.
- **formatArrayStrings**: This function takes two arrays as input: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizes the string if the number is even, and converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 2: userInfo.js
- **createUserProfiles**: This function takes two arrays as input: an array of original names and an array of modified names (from Task 1). It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and an auto-incremented `id` starting from 1.
